# Isodi

Isodi is a library for isometric games.

Isodi combines 2D and 3D in a way to make it possible to create good looking games without the need to create
a special model for every object.

The library uses Raylib to render by default, but it designed so it shouldn't be hard to bind it to another library.

**Note:** Isodi is currently in early development, documentation isn't complete and not all features
are implemented. Use with care.

## Documentation

Isodi is still in early development, so the documentation may be incomplete. It attempts to be compatible with DDox,
meaning you can build the documentation using `dub build -b=ddox`
