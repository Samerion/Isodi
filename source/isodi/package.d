/// Isodi is a library for isometric games.
///
/// Isodi combines 2D and 3D in a way to make it possible to create good looking games without the need to create
/// a special model for every object.
///
/// The library uses Raylib to render by default, but it designed so it shouldn't be hard to rewrite it to another
/// library.
///
/// $(B Note:) Isodi is currently in early development, documentation isn't complete and not all features
/// are implemented. Use with care.
///
/// See `isodi.display.Display` to get started!
